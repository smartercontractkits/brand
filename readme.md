# backgrounder.md
This is an “about us” section, and should include all of the basics: who, what, where, when, why, and how. It is important to remember consistency in the messaging, while keeping the backgrounder fairly brief. This portion is directed at the media and their time is valuable; therefore, you should use headings to help them find the portion that is most important to their needs.

# presscoverage.md
Self-explanatory. Make sure that they are recent, with **nothing older than six months**. These can be regularly swapped out to keep things updated and fresh. The press release heading should clearly describe its content for an easy glance in case the media is looking for a specific announcement. Remember that press begets more press because it shows journalists that other outlets care about you and what you’re doing. It will make them more inclined to trust us and include nuLink in the stories they are working on. In particular, journalists that are working on broadcast stories are more likely to use our thoughts if they are able to show examples of previous on-camera experience. Draw attention to this; let them know what examples are visual versus written, because they won’t have the time to click on all of the links. Also, remember that every article is copyrighted, including the outlet’s logo/image. You can include the name of the outlet and a link to the original article and/or to archiving sites, but **you cannot make a PDF, rewrite the article, or use the outlet’s logo without the proper permission**.

# faq.md
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) (since the industry, and the product, is technical in nature and/or changes on a consistent basis). This section is helpful for the reporter and may also spur an additional idea that the writer had not previously thought of. Outline the **most important features and details in quick simple bullets**.

# casestudies
A way to showcase the effectiveness or success of the product to the media. When crafting this document, think of it as customer testimonials taken to the next level. Remember that this is for the media, not for marketing purposes. Be sure that any collateral, including case studies, **do not have promotional ties**. It is common for the media to include these items in their articles, but they will not use it if it is from the angle of self-promotion.

# artworks
Include all the digital assets that are media-ready, meaning they can instantly be put up onto a website, included in a magazine, or memed, to help tell the story. Files, logos or product images, must be high-resolution and in .png or .svg format. Better if both for each file. If so, name them with the same name. **Be sure to have the rights to every image**.
