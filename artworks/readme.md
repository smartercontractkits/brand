Since the goal of promoting openness, innovation and opportunity on the blockchain, extends through everything we do, this guide serves as a resource to bring together all the brands, and to help define their visual and stylistic elements. It exists to provide the tools and assets needed to further the mission through communications, websites, products and more. Consistency will make the design better and easier to use, tying together elements in a single form, and creating a product that is distinguishable, usable, and effective.

> cube.png and hexagon.png represent the logos, and are generally mutually interchangeable, but hexagon.png, because of its graphic simplicity, is always to be preferred for use-cases where the final output is a small icon.

> name.png, self-explanatory; grapheme.png instead is to be used in cases of space restriction which for obvious reasons makes it difficult to use (not only beacuse of its prtical implementation, but also because of its graphic legibility) name.png.

> socketed.png and io.png respectively depicts the on-chain and the off-chain infrastructure's architectural components of the blockchain, and should be used to visually defines an alike idea of contracts deployment/processing.

> paletteone.png and palettetwo.png are the colour references for graphic compositions; the former outlines the basic scheme (adequate for most situations), the latter gives the greenscale range.
