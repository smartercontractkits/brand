## Basics
* NuLink is a platform which attempts to bridge the gap between smart contracts on the blockchain and real-world applications, which often tend to be off the blockchain.

* The cryptocurrency uses “oracles”, which find and verify real-world data and bring it on-chain to be integrated into smart contracts.

## Development
* Like the inherent nature of the blockchain technology, the core develompnet of NuLink is based on a decentralised effort of different people (rather than a single entity) who want to make a difference in the blockchain technology.

## Why
* Since Smart Contracts are pretty much inaccessible to people who has no intention to adopt the blockchain technology, NuLink solves the problem by bridging the gap between Smart Contracts restricted to the blockchain ecosystem and the real world.

* The “oracles” that NuLink uses do exist currently, but they’re all centralized, defeating the purpose of the decentralized smart contacts and blockchain technology. NuLink makes the entire process decentralized.

## Technology
* Since it does the work of bridging the gap between on-chain smart contracts and off-chain businesses and data, it has two main architectural components: **on-chain infrastructure** and **off-chain infrastructure**.

* The on-chain infrastructure consists of on-chain contracts deployed on Ethereum’s blockchain. These are Oracle contracts, which process the data requests of users who wish to access off-chain data.

* Users who want data from off the blockchain ecosystem submit a requesting contract to NuLink’s network, which in turn processes these requests into its own contracts, which match the user’s contract to existing oracles which are appropriate for the application.

* The contracts include: a **reputation contract**, which checks an oracle provider’s track to verify its authenticity, an **order-matching contract**, which logs the user contract’s agreement on the network and takes bids from responsible oracle providers, and an **aggregating contact**, which accumulates data from the chosen oracles and balances them for an accurate result.

* The on-chain functions of ChainLink follows a three-step process using the above-mentioned contracts. **Oracle Selection**: the user contract contains a Service Level Agreement (SLA) which specifies parameters and requirements for the user’s data search, which may include oracle reputation, specifics of the data required, number of resources needed, etc. Users can use filters and search manually for available oracles. NuLink also provides an automated matching engine in which oracles bid based on the SLA, when manual searching is infeasible. **Data Reporting**: chosen off-chain oracles carry out the service agreement mentioned in the user contract and transmit the data to the blockchain for on-chain nodes to process. **Result Aggregation**: an aggregating contract is used to collect data submitted by the oracles and balances all the data to provide the user with accurate data. This step is necessary to ensure data integrity and prevent tampering.

* User contracts have the option of implementing a penalty fee for misbehaviour which the oracles would be liable to pay.

* The off-chain infrastructure consists of oracle nodes connected to the Ethereum Network, which collect the user-requested data from off-chain resources. The data received is processed through the NuLink Core, the software which allows the interaction between the off-chain infrastructure and the blockchain.

* In return for their contribution to the network harvesting and data transmission, the off-chain oracle operators are compensated in the form of LINK, NuLink’s native ERC20 token.

* Additionally, off-chain nodes allow developers to integrate external adapters; plugins that operators use to accommodate other programs to their basic operations and perform subtasks to streamline data collection.

* To solve the issues associated with a centralized oracle system which can be tampered with, NuLink implements “source and oracle distribution”, meaning it uses multiple oracles to collect data for a single user contract, and these oracles, in turn, are expected to use multiple resources for their data collection. This successfully ensures integrity in the platform and accuracy of the data collected.

* Further protection is provided by a technology called Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGS), which creates an “enclave” where certain protected areas of memory can’t be changed. This keeps oracles honest even if they are operated by an owner with a conflict of interest in a contract.

## Future
* NuLink’s airdrop was held in February 2020, with the distribution of 820,572,233 NLINK tokens out of 900,000,000,000. The remaining 899,179,427,767 (99.9088%) non-distributed ones were burned (address [0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001](https://etherscan.io/token/0x493c8d6a973246a7b26aa8ef4b1494867a825de5?a=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001)). The de facto circulating available supply has consequently become of 820,572,233 NLINK tokens.

* The tokens can seem interesting for a long-term involvement, and an opportunity particularly due to their low participation cost, which tends to have a positive psychological impact on the mass adoption.

* Bringing the previously unavailable Smart Contract technology to real-world applications is a revolutionary idea, and with the increasing popularity of the technology, it is certain to prove extremely useful in the future. Why people may pick this coin over the others offering similar services, is a question that will require them to study its competitors closely ass well.
