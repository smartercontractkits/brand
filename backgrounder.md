## Basics
* NuLink is a platform which attempts to bridge the gap between smart contracts on the blockchain and real-world applications, which often tend to be off the blockchain.

* The cryptocurrency uses “oracles”, which find and verify real-world data and bring it on-chain to be integrated into smart contracts.

## Development
* Like the inherent nature of the blockchain technology, the core develompnet of NuLink is based on a decentralised effort of different people (rather than a single entity) who want to make a difference in the blockchain technology.

## Why
* Since Smart Contracts are pretty much inaccessible to people who has no intention to adopt the blockchain technology, NuLink solves the problem by bridging the gap between Smart Contracts restricted to the blockchain ecosystem and the real world.

* The “oracles” that NuLink uses do exist currently, but they’re all centralized, defeating the purpose of the decentralized smart contacts and blockchain technology. NuLink makes the entire process decentralized.

## Future
* NuLink’s airdrop was held in February 2020, with the distribution of 820,572,233 NLINK tokens out of 900,000,000,000. The remaining 899,179,427,767 (99.9088%) non-distributed ones were burned (address [0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001](https://etherscan.io/token/0x493c8d6a973246a7b26aa8ef4b1494867a825de5?a=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001)). The de facto circulating available supply has consequently become of 820,572,233 NLINK tokens.

* The tokens can seem interesting for a long-term involvement, and an opportunity particularly due to their low participation cost, which tends to have a positive psychological impact on the mass adoption.

* Bringing the previously unavailable Smart Contract technology to real-world applications is a revolutionary idea, and with the increasing popularity of the technology, it is certain to prove extremely useful in the future. Why people may pick this coin over the others offering similar services, is a question that will require them to study its competitors closely ass well.
